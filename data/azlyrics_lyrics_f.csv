promets, apres je disparais, il fallait juste que je te parle de quelque chose, et je me connais, si je le fais pas maintenant je vais encore me defiler et m'en vouloir, j'arrive pas a te sortir de mes pensees, je peux pas te le dire autrement, en meme temps c'est pas tres complique, je pense que tu comprends, je suis desole si c'est un peu direct mais je me dis qu'on n'a qu'une vie, qu'elle est trop courte, trop fragile, et puis vaut mieux avoir des remords que des regrets, je sais pas d'ou ca sort, je sais pas d'ou ca vient, je pourrais pas te l'expliquer, et je comprendrais que tu me prennes pour un dingue, je t'en voudrais pas, c'est juste que quand je te vois, ca fait des flashs dans ma tete, il y a des images qui se repetent en boucle, et j'ai besoin d'en avoir le coeur net, je nous vois danser au ralenti sur du rub a dub et toi tu me deposes des mots precieux au creux de l'oreille, on se regarde droit dans les yeux, on veille jusqu'au lever du soleil, je nous vois sortir marcher boire et partir sans payer, tirer des plans sur la comete, et faire l'amour les fenetres ouvertes, alors je vais pas te mentir sur le marche je suis pas forcement ce qu'il y a de meilleur, parce que je suis bancal menteur pas fiable jamais a l'heure, mais si tu veux je peux me faire boxeur, voleur, chauffeur, docteur, serviteur, dresseur de lions, je vais pas te mentir tu pourras forcement trouver mieux, parce que je suis maladroit, nerveux, egoiste et colereux, mais si tu veux je peux etre souriant et meme heureux, poli, genereux, ecrire des morceaux moins teigneux, ou meme des chansons pour les amoureux, c'est etrange parce que je me sens a la fois un peu ridicule de te balancer tout ca d'un coup, et en meme temps ca me fait beaucoup de bien, d'abord parce que je peux enfin etre fixe sur ce qui se passe de ton cote, mais aussi parce que je realise la chance que j'ai, de pouvoir encore avoir des sentiments pour quelqu'un, ca me change tellement la vie, tu te rends pas compte je crois, j'ai l'impression de plus etre la meme personne, c'est comme si d'un coup je me remettais d'une cuite qui avait dure genre deux ans, c'est long deux ans. je me sens different, j'ai envie de me lever a l'heure, de me remettre en mouvement, de moins fumer, de moins boire, de plus draguer n'importe qui par peur de la solitude, je sais pas d'ou ca sort, je sais pas d'ou ca vient, je pourrais pas te l'expliquer encore une fois, ca faisait tellement longtemps que ca m'etait pas arrive, et la ca me tombe dessus comme ca, moi jusque-la je faisais un peu n'importe quoi, je passais d'une personne a une autre sans reussir a m'attacher vraiment, c'etait assez glauque mais bon, je suis comme tout le monde, alors que la je nous vois carrement danser au ralenti sur du rub a dub au corps a corps, on se regarde droit dans les yeux et puis on repart en tirant des bords, je nous vois courir nager nus rougir transpirer jusqu'a bruler, tirer des plans sur jupiter et faire l'amour sous les eclairs, alors je vais pas te mentir sur le marche je suis pas forcement ce qu'il y a de meilleur, parce que je suis bancal menteur pas fiable jamais a l'heure, mais si tu veux je

si tu veux qu'on se lance, qu'on essaie, moi je pense que ca peut donner quelque chose de beau, parce qu'apres tout on sait jamais, et meme si tu vois, que je suis pas quelqu'un pour toi, si le soir quand ca va pas, que t'es triste, qu'il y a quoique ce soit, fais-moi signe, je bouge pas, je te promets, je serai la, enfin voila, je vais pas te mentir sur le marche je suis pas forcement ce qu'il y

contre je peux te demander de me croire quand je te dis tout ce que je te dis ce soir, je suis pas un enieme connard qui veut juste coucher avec toi, me mets pas dans le meme sac, c'est tout ce que je te demande, allez, je vais te laisser tranquille maintenant, je parle beaucoup, je sais, je suis desole, tu peux me repondre plus tard t'en fais pas le temps digerer tout ca, y a rien d'urgent, d'ici
